This website is for entertainment purposes. It is for people who loves music and want to test themselves in their knowledge of music.


Design Process:

Firstly, we started of with the html pages using bootstrap and css for the design. While doing all that, we also started researching and trying out the javascript to make the multiple choice quiz for the game. We started of by focusing on one game page so that we could just copy paste to the other pages after. Pop was the one we started with. After figuring out out to do the multiple choice quiz, we implemented it with our html and css design. Afterwards, we went to search and edit the songs that we were going to use and added it into the javascript so that it will play when a specific question is asked. Once we were able to ensure that the song played and the timer worked, we added a points system so that users could keep track of how many questions they got right. We wanted it to be simple so we added a +100 points for each correct answer that they gave and no points if it was wrong. After that we started working on the scoreboard page so that users who want to save their scores can fill up the form and save it to the database that we created. After all that was done, we did some minor changes to ensure that the website looked cleaner and there were no errors.
